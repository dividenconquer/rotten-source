TLDR.

- The repository was created to address the issue of outdated libraries on GitHub. It evaluates repository scores based on several criteria, but the score does not indicate completeness or value. The hope is for it to help users find desired repositories quickly, and for maintainers to aim for higher goals. The criteria for the score are opinionated and may change in the future with the help of contributors.

Why I created this repository:

- GitHub has been around for about 15 years since its inception in 2008. Many sources have been uploaded to GitHub, including a lot of libraries that are no longer being maintained. I have spent too much time trying to use libraries that no longer work, so I created this repository to address that issue.
- The critic score of a repository is evaluated based on several criteria such as commits, issues, pull requests, stars, and the scores are calculated from 0 to 100 by averaging them.

Note:

- This score does not necessarily indicate the actual completeness or value of a repository.
- Hopefully, it can help find repositories as quickly as possible when searching for the desired repository on GitHub.
- Maintainers that manage open-source can use this critic scores to aim for higher goals.
- The critic's score calculation criteria are opinionated. It would be great if a more fair standard can be created in the future with the help of many contributors.
